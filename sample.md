# Pradarsh

This is a software to present slides.

This renders markdown directly into presentable slides. This presentation itself is made in Pradarsh!

## How to present a Markdown file?

Just upload a markdown file and we handle all the rest. The slides are distributed with specifics such as the amount of text and headings so that the text is never too small to present.

## Any keybindings?
